# 🖊️ Pen Fight (Vanilla JS)

A web-based version of the classic **Pen Fight game** we used to play on school desks — built with **pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** (no frameworks, no libraries).

## 🎮 How It Works

- Players place their pens inside the arena.
- Players take turns **flicking** their pen by dragging and releasing with the mouse (or touch).
- The pen slides with velocity, slows down due to friction.
- If your pen collides and pushes the opponent outside the arena, you win!

## ✨ Features

- 🕹️ Simple drag + release controls (mouse or touch)
- ⚡ Realistic(ish) sliding + bouncing physics
- 🔄 Turn-based with BOT
- 🏆 Win condition when a pen is knocked out
- 🎨 Clean, minimal UI using only vanilla CSS

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5 Canvas** for rendering
- **CSS3** for styling
- **JavaScript (ES6)** for game logic + physics

No frameworks. No external physics engines. Just raw vanilla code.
